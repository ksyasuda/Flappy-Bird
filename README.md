Flappy Bird game written using the p5.js JavaScript framework

Still left to do: Add background, tweak gravity/flying mechanics, add better ground, add rotation of the bird when flying up and when
falling down, and add pipe images instead of rects

Eventually I will implement the genetic algorithm on top of this program, but that will happen after the cleanup as talked about above
